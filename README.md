DCC data storage project

This project was given to me by Brendan Mason at the Detroit Crime Commission. I was tasked with converting their digital storage system into a search-data structure. It consists of two programs. The first (table_maker) is a program that behaves sort of like a spider. It goes into a given directory and searches all of its child directories for word docs. If a word doc is found, relevant data fields are pulled from it and cached into a CSV file.
The second program (DCC Analysis interface) is a GUI that assists DCC analysts in navigating, searching, and filtering the data. It is designed to minimize the effort from the analysts and maximize productivity when accessing investigative information. 

NO SENSITIVE DATA IS CONTAINED.
